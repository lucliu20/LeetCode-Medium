# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/

"""
Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13
Output: 0
Explanation: One possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 5 from the second row.
- Choose 7 from the third row.
The sum of the chosen elements is 13, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 0.

Example 2:
Input: mat = [[1],[2],[3]], target = 100
Output: 94
Explanation: The best possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 2 from the second row.
- Choose 3 from the third row.
The sum of the chosen elements is 6, and the absolute difference is 94.

Example 3:
Input: mat = [[1,2,9,8,7]], target = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The best choice is to choose 7 from the first row.
The absolute difference is 1.
